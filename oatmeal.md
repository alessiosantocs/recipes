# Warmy morning sugar-free oatmeal

### Cooking oatmeal
The basic recipe is 1/2 cup of oats, 1 cup of water/milk-of-choice and 1 pinch of salt. The best way I found is by the oatmeal artist: bring water/milk-of-choice to boil then add oats and decrese heat to medium.

It will make one fulfilling cup of oatmeal.

I loved oatmealartist's almond joy oatmeal. I decided to fork it here to make my own version.
##### Ingredients
- 3 tablespoons of unsweeetened cocoa powder (organic is better!)
- 1 ripe banana

##### Instructions
Use a half banana to prepare some sort of banana syrup (it's actually water that tastes like bananas) using a small pan and some water.
Cook the oats as usual using the banana syrup. Add nuts and vanilla.
Cook the other hakf of a banana in the oven or microwave as is. When really creamy take it out.
Serve in a cup and add the cooked banana on top and a bit of vanilla powder and some nuts if you want.

# Lovely overnight sugar-free oatmeal
Yes, overnight! No need to cook or boil stuff. Oats will slowly cook themself in the fridge!

I have 2 ideas of overnight oatmeal. The first one is the multi-layered one where you basically put stuff on top of another and then eat everything together in the morning. This will make your oats really soft but they will not taste of the other stuff you put in.
The other idea is something similar to the bircher muesli. This is pretty raw I have to admit. Just put stuff together with a lot of milk and yoghurt and stir properly. In the morning you'll have a nice and tasty cup of oatmeal anyway.

That said, go for the one you prefer! Oh... use a jar of medium dimensions so you have your topping coming out of it!

## Raspberry almond oatmeal
##### Ingredients
- 3 tablespoons of organic breakfast cereals or granola
- 1/2 cup of natural plain yogurt
- 1/2 cup of oats
- 1 tablespoon of chia seeds
- 1/2 cup of almond milk (1/2 more if doing bircher)
- 1 cup of fresh/frozen raspberries
- 1 pinch of ground vanilla bourbon

##### Instructions
No matter what keep cereals on the bottom of the jar.

If you're doing the multi-layered oatmeal use the order that makes sense to you or just stick to the list order. 

if doing the bircher - add 1/2 cup of almond milk - put all the ingredients in the jar and stir until everything's mixed up. Leave some raspberries and vanilla aside as you'll use them for the topping!


## Coconut Matcha oatmeal
##### Ingredients
- 1/2 cup of oats
- 1 teaspoon of chia seeds (optional)
- 2 tablespoons of unsweetened matcha powder
- 1/2 cup of coconut milk
- 2 as fresh as possible really good dates (cut them into small pieces)
- shredded coconut
- sliced almonds

##### Instructions
If you're doing the multi-layered oatmeal mix the milk and the matcha powder in a bowl aside and then stick to the list to make your layers.

if doing the bircher put all the ingredients in the jar and stir until everything's mixed up.

Use almonds and coconut for topping. You can add a piece of date on top too (and eat the rest right away ;)).
